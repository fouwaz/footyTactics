            In this web page we present several football formations, when they are used, their strengths, weaknesses and the
            purpose of each one.
            We also give historical backgrounds and mention the managers and innovators of each formation.

        <h1 class="header1"> The 4-4-2</h1>
        
        <p class="Paragraph"> There are mainly two ways to implement the 4-4-2 shape, the diamond shape and the flat shape. </p>
        <h2 class="header2"> The Diamond 4-4-2 </h2>
        <figure class="figures">

             <figcaption class="figCaption"> The 4-4-2 diamond shape on the field</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="Paragraph">In this shape the midfield is close and narrow, the system uses a single pivot (CDM) with two box to box players 
            next to each other (CM).
            <br>
            The two strikers could both be two true goal scorers, or one could act as a second triker to help link up the 
            offense and the midfield by helping the attacking central midfield (ACM). The midfield forms a diamond which allows
            the bloc to be compact while pressing or defending in the last third of the field.
        </p>
        <h3 class="header3"> Historical background</h3>
        <p class="Paragraph"> This formation was first used by Hungary's and England's national teams in the 1966 world cup. <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrigo_Sacchi"> Arrigo Sacchi</a> was the main 
        developer of this formation in the 80's and 90's with <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan">A.C. Milan</a>
        The team witnissed much success by winning demostic and european titles in that period. It was also implemented later on in the italian national team.
        Which won the 2006 world cup in Germany.
        </p>
        <h3 class="header3"> Advantages </h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="listElem">Controls the midfield section because of playing two Registas and a holding midfielder.</li>
            <li class="listElem">Using the half spaces adequately especially by the registas.</li>
            <li class="listElem">Freedom for the CAM because of the midfield protection.</li>
            <li class="listElem">Capability of having a front 3.</li>
            <li class="listElem">Presses effectively by allowing the venter forwards to go wide out of possession.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="header3"> Distadvantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="listElem">Inability to create triangles on the sides of the field because of the absence of the wingers.</li>
            <li class="listElem">Difficult to defend a winger/fullback combination.</li>
            <li class="listElem">Requires excellent full backs to contribute on both ends of the field.</li>
            <li class="listElem">Requires a creative CAM who can finish and playmaker.</li>
        </ul>

            <figcaption class="figCaption"> The 4-4-2 flat shape on the field</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="Paragraph">
            This shape is wider than the diamond 4-4-2. It consists of the standard 4 backline and the two strikers upfront. The change comes
            in the midfield where the coach uses a double pivot (two central defensive midfielders) in addition to two wingers to attack in wider areas. 
        </p>

        <p class="Paragraph">
            Dont actually know, for now.
        </p>
        <h3 class="header3"> Advantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="listElem">Can attack wider and use a diamond or triangle on both wings.</li>
            <li class="listElem">Can defend the wings and the middle of the field.</li>
            <li class="listElem">Gives freedom to the two strikers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="header3">Disatvantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="listElem">Basically losing the midfield.</li>
            <li class="listElem">Giving the opposition space between the lines.</li>
            <li class="listElem">Weak pressing in the middle of the field</li>
            <li class="listElem">Unstable against a 3 shaped midfield</li>

            </figure>
            <p class="Paragraph">
                This shape consists of the standard backline with 4 defenders. In addition to that, the midfield consists of a
                central defensive midfielder (CDM) and two box to box players (CM), who are the most important players in this rotation.<br>
                The front line could vary, we could use two wingers and a true striker as a center forward or we could use a false 9 who
                drops to the midfield near the the two box to box players while the two wingers ger narrow and turn into strikers.<br>
                This formation is used by managers who are offensively-minded. Who like to keep the ball and win back possession as soon as
                they lose it, Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola">Pep Guardiola</a>,  
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Klopp">Jürgen Klopp</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinedine_Zidane">Zinedine Zidane</a>.
            </p>
            <h3 class="header3">Historical Background</h3>
            <p class="Paragraph">
                This shape was first used by Germany's national team in the 1974 world cup, which they won. It
                was then used by the Dutsch team which developed the style of ball possession and domination.
                One of the best teams to use this shape is the 2009-2012 Fc Barcelona under Pep Guardiola. The current
                Manchester city and Liverpool use the same shape with different ideas, the two teams are currently the
                most offensive and the best teams in the world.
            </p>
            <h3 class="header3">Advantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="listElem"> Enables to take control of the game by holding possession.</li>
                <li class="listElem">Can link triangles of players almost everywhere on the field.</li>
                <li class="listElem">Can use different ideas as explained before, like a false 9.</li>
                <li class="listElem">Can apply effective high press in different ways</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="header3"> Distadvantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="listElem"> Fragile against fast counter attacks.</li>
                <li class="listElem">The defensive line has to be high if the team were to press.</li>
                <li class="listElem">The isolation of the CDM</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="header3">Historical Background</h3>
            <p class="Paragraph">
                This shape is considered to be modern, it was mostly used in the period 2007-2012. The first manager that comes
                into my mind when talking about this shape is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho">José Mourinho</a>. He
                used it, mainly, to counter Barcelona's 4-3-3 shape presented in the previous section. It is considered by most people
                as a defensive-type scheme with a standard backline with two central midfielders (a double pivot). One of which is a traditional CDM, while
                the other is more of a regista or a box to box player. Infront of them, there is a central atacking midfielder whose role
                is playmaking with two wingers and a striker upfront.
            </p>
            <h3 class="header3">Advantages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="listElem"> Each players roles are clear.</li>
                <li class="listElem"> The best formation to cover all of the space.</li>
                <li class="listElem"> A balanced formation between offense and defense.</li>
                <li class="listElem"> The spreading allows for smooth transitions.</li>
                <li class="listElem"> The ability to optimally use the fullbacks offensively, because the double pivot can cover.</li>
                <li class="listElem"> Easy to integrate players.</li>
                <li class="listElem"> A good match for any other formation.</li>
